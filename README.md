fe‑timesheets: A no-fuss, highly efficient timesheet approval tool built for field teams. It’s intuitive, fast, and priced to fit smaller budgets — helping you streamline field operations without breaking the bank.

Why It Works for You
1. Ultra-Simple & Intuitive
Designed for field engineers who aren’t software experts — submission is one-click, approval is just as easy.

No complex modules or bloated workflows: just timesheet entry → client contact review → admin oversight.

2. Multistage, Multilocation Workflow
Field engineers submit hours, which go directly to a designated client contact based on region.

That contact reviews via a secure, one-time link in their email and either approves or adds feedback.

Once approved by the client, the timesheet reaches an admin for final review — then it’s fully approved, or sent back for correction with a clear comment.

This ensures dual oversight: client verification and administrative control, minimizing errors before payroll processing.

3. Transparent Communication & Accountability
Rejected timesheets must include a note explaining why — ensures accountability and minimizes back-and-forth email chains.

Technicians receive email alerts to revise and resubmit, with clear, actionable feedback.

4. Audit Trail for Compliance
Every step is timestamped and recorded — who approved, when, and why.

Great for tracing approvals, resolving disputes, supporting audits, and maintaining compliance — a key factor highlighted by Rippling in their 2025 review of SMB time-tracking tools

5. Save Time, Cutting Errors & Costs

Reduces manual mistakes and payroll discrepancy, aligning with best-in-class small-business solutions .
